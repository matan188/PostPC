## Ex1: Simple Chat App 
The app presents a text area and a button where the user can add items to a list. 
In a way, we could say the user can chat with himself. 

### Views used
EditText: Where the user can write the new text item he wants to add to the list.

Button: When clicked, the current text in the EditText view will be added to the list.

ListView: List of all the items added so far. 

In order to make the ListView work, we used an adapter and a list layout.
